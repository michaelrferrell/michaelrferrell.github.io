Using USB connections, the Pi links to the controls and DAQ systems. The Pi also acts as a local server, facilitating remote communication for our team in the bunker. In real-time, the Pi uploads data from DAQ to a Grafana dashboard, enabling rapid assessment of the performance of propulsion systems during tests. </p>

                <p> The switchbox, as the name implies, is a box of switches that sends commands that activate and deactivate solenoid valves at the pad. My team developed a wireless switchbox system that uses an ESP32 to transmit commands over Wi-Fi to the Raspberry Pi. We started with breadboards to validate component selections and to write the code. Once the design was thoroughly tested, my team designed a simple PCB to house all the components. We also made a wired switchbox system that sends commands via RS-485 directly to the control system. I decided to have this redundant system as a failsafe in case the Pi failed. </p>

                <p> The control system, triggered by commands from the switchbox, is designed for precise control over solenoids, either supplying or cutting off 24V as needed. I implemented this functionality using an Arduino that controls 16 electromechanical relays through a 16-channel IO expander. Each relay, connected to a solenoid, establishes continuity between the common and normally open terminals when signaled by a low input from the IO expander, delivering 24V to the solenoid. I employed diode safeguards against back EMF, ensuring circuit integrity. Rigorous testing on breadboards, akin to the switchbox, validated component performance and wiring accuracy. With a verified schematic, I developed a PCB housing the Arduino, IO expander, diodes, and a MAX485 module for the wired switchbox setup. The PCB also accommodates two 8-channel relays that directly plug into the PCB. Given the critical safety implications, I conducted thorough tests to confirm the solenoids' reliable actuation and deactivation. Additionally, I designed an automatic abort feature, initiated by a 30-second timer in the absence of switchbox communication, to safe state the solenoids if connectivity is not restored within the designated timeframe. </p>

                <p> The DAQ system logs critical parameters such as pressure, engine and tank temperatures, tank fill levels, and thrust. Currently, the system accommodates 10 pressure transducers, 5 thermocouples, and 5 load cells. I designed specialized PCBs to handle analog signals from thermocouples and load cells, amplifying and processing them through ADCs, with an ESP32 managing thermocouple data and an Arduino handling load cell data. I mounted a 10-channel ADC on the Pi to process pressure data to conserve space. I designed another PCB that employs optocouplers to convert 24V solenoid signals to 5V signals. They can then be processed by an Arduino, enabling remote confirmation of the solenoid states without on-site personnel. The Pi efficiently processes and simultaneously stores and streams all data to a Grafana GUI. </p>

Measuring the capacitance change as the tanks are filled should provide more accurate data. Stay tuned for updates! </p>

                <p> From December 2022 to June 2023, I had the privilege of contributing to the avionics system for Rocket Project's hybrid team. The rocket was fueled by a blend of nitrous and ABS, with an anticipated apogee of around 10,000 feet. Our system played a crucial role in logging all in-flight data and transmitting it, enabling the team to access real-time information on altitude, vertical acceleration, location, and more. The hybrid team has had a history of avionics failures, from transmission to power. No team had ever implemented an avionics system that worked throughout the day of launch. This gave us a chip on our shoulder as we designed our system.   </p>

                <p> Our system consisted of two altimeters, one 6-DOF IMU, one GPS, and a 1W LoRa transceiver. To improve on previous years, we used two altimeters for redundancy and more accurate data, along with an upgraded transceiver to ensure that at apogee we could receive live data. We used the Teensy 4.1 as the microcontroller due to its 600 MHz processor, SD socket, and lightweight frame. The SD socket allowed us to store all data on a microSD card. To power the system, we had a pair of 3.7 batteries in parallel with another pair for a combined voltage of 7.4V. We decided to utilize two pairs to increase the runtime and have redundancy in case one pair failed. To ensure that the system would last throughout the launch day, we implemented a pull-pin switch that could power on and off the system. The pin was accessible via a small hole in the nosecone, which allowed us to pull it right before launch. </p>

                <p> My main contributions were the PCB design and PCB assembly. I used Autodesk Eagle to design the schematic and PCB. I ended up with a two-layer 3.75” x 3.75” PCB that housed all the components. I worked closely with our Vehicle Engineering team to ensure the PCB would fit within the housing unit and was within an approved weight. This was my first time ever designing a PCB, so it took a couple of tries to get it right. However, it came easy once I got the hang of the software and learned the design rules. I had never soldered before and we picked SMD components, which made assembly challenging. Maybe the best way to learn is to start in the deep end! I also worked on the transmission code on the Teensy. Most notably, I fixed an interference issue between the GPS and transceiver by programming them to operate in offsetting intervals. </p>

                <p> Unfortunately, the pneumatic lines didn't disconnect during launch, leading to an automatic abort. The engine fired briefly before shutting off. Avionics confirmed a max apogee of 40 feet and max velocity of 46 ft/s. Post-recovery, it was discovered the avionics system would have lasted another 7 hours. Despite the setback, achieving live data reception and logging on the SD card while on the rail was a milestone for the hybrid team. </p>

                <p> Programming has been a passion of mine since elementary school. I thought then that I would grow up to be a game developer. Over the years, I have taken several programming classes, which have taught me Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and C++. While I am not the most talented developer, I can hold my own in the above languages. Currently, most of the programming I engage in is for the microcontrollers utilized by my Ground Systems team. I also use Python for data analysis after we conduct propulsion tests. In my free time, I work on personal projects, such as developing this website. I am very interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence and hope to gain experience working on projects that utilize both. </p>

                <p> One of my classes featured a challenging final project that tasked me with creating a Pac-Man-style arcade game entirely from scratch. The resulting game is a tick-based adventure where the player assumes the role of a miner on a quest to discover all the hidden barrels of oil within the map. At the commencement of each level, gold and oil are dispersed randomly beneath the pink earth. Additional game elements are added spontaneously after a minimum number of ticks. Various items are uncovered as the player mines and added to their inventory. The player can utilize these items during the level or save them for more challenging levels. Amid the quest for buried oil, the player must contend with default and advanced enemies, who both can pursue the player. When the player is within direct line of sight, these enemies will chase them. Advanced enemies also utilize a queue-based maze algorithm to track the player when within a predefined set of legal moves.</p>

                <p> This complex project featured numerous dynamic components and intricate rules, posing challenges in organization and management. With hundreds of dynamically allocated game objects, each potentially deleted during a tick, I needed to be creative in structuring my classes, implementing inheritance, and optimizing object storage. Simplifying the process, I identified shared characteristics among game objects and grouped them under a unified base class. This hierarchical grouping continued until the lowest-level derived classes contained unique code. Interaction between classes was intricate, requiring careful design to avoid violating encapsulation. I heavily relied on accessor and mutator functions, defined at the highest class hierarchy level, enabling, for example, the "GameWorld" class to update the player's inventory, exemplifying the intricate interplay of various elements.</p>
